# Souls of Singular Alexandrov Spaces?

This directory contains the outlines of an ongoing research project wherein we apply our results on Kantorovich's contravariant singularity functor to Alexandrov spaces. Our main goal is to obtain a new proof of Perelman's Soul theorem, and especially with applications to singular Alexandrov spaces.
