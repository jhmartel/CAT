        "By Maxwell equations we understand the following: in a given reference frame $K$ we have the existence of electric and magnetic fields $E,B$ satisfying [equations].

The classical homogeneous wave equation has the property of the velocity being *dependant* on the receiver velocity. But SR rushedly argues that the assumption (A12) on the \"rectilinear uniform propagation of light\" somehow yields a wave equation where velocity is receiver *independant*. But how? \n",
